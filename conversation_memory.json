It really depends on whether you want to *use* an existing service or *build* your own from scratch.\n\n1.  **Using an Existing API:** There are many services like Cloudinary, AWS Rekognition, or Google Cloud Vision that offer powerful image manipulation, including cropping. You'd usually sign up with them, get an API key, and follow their specific instructions to send an image and the cropping details (like coordinates). Super handy! \ud83d\udc4d\n2.  **Building Your Own API:** If you want to build it yourself, you'd typically:\n    *   Choose a backend language/framework (like Python/Flask, Node.js/Express).\n    *   Use an image processing library (like Pillow for Python, Sharp for Node.js).\n    *   Create an API endpoint (e.g., `/crop`) that accepts the image and crop parameters (x, y, width, height).\n    *   Write the code to perform the actual crop using the library.\n    *   Return the resulting cropped image.\n\nIt's getting pretty late (00:26!), but this is a fun technical topic! \ud83d\ude04 Do either of these sound like what you had in mind, or do you have a specific platform or language you're thinking of using?

A lot of his wealth is tied up in stocks of his companies, so his net worth can swing like crazy depending on the stock market! He famously doesn't take a huge salary from Tesla, for example.\n\nBut if you're thinking about *Tesla's* turnover (their revenue), that's a huge number!
